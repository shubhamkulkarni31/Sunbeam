#if 0

One more common use of conditional compilation involves using #if 0 to exclude a block of code from being compiled (as if it were inside a comment block):

#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Joe\n";
 
#if 0 // Don't compile anything starting here
    std::cout << "Bob\n";
    std::cout << "Steve\n";
#endif // until this point
 
    return 0;
}
The above code only prints “Joe”, because “Bob” and “Steve” were inside an #if 0 block that the preprocessor will exclude from compilation.

This provides a convenient way to “comment out” code that contains multi-line comments.
